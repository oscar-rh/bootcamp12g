                          step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. 
                          They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no
                          tutorial could ever have. In fact, I´ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my development experience. it certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack 
                          developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommended!. "</p>
